# Swifty Proteins - Setup and Usage Guide

## Overview

Swifty Proteins is a cross-platform mobile application developed using Flutter, designed for the 3D visualization of ligands from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). This application allows users to:

- Search for ligands.
- Interact with 3D models of ligands (zoom, rotate, etc.).
- Display atomic structures with tooltips showing atom information.
- Share ligand models via social media.

This guide provides instructions for setting up the development environment, building, and deploying the project for both Android and iOS platforms.
